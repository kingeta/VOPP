# VOPP - Virtual Operation Process Planning

## What is VOPP?
[VOPP](https://github.com/kingeta/VOPP) is Python-based library that improves the logistics of warehouses and businesses that exchange packages and physical goods between each other. VOPP reduces costs associated with package management by improving packaging efficiency whilst also reducing the number of errors made in the process. It is a fully integrated end-to-end solution that provides a complete loop for warehouses and their customers and contractors to optimize their logistics.

## Why should our business use VOPP?
VOPP is a Free-and-Open-Source package licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/kingeta/VOPP/blob/main/LICENSE), so it is ideal for SMEs that want to reduce their logistics costs without paying for an expensive commercial solution. VOPP is completely modular and flexible, consisting of multiple interconnected components that can be used for other parts of the business and hence connect to existing solutions in a non-disruptive manner. Furthermore, the intuitive UI of the VOPP web app is very easy to use and doesn't require the employees to endure a steep learning curve.
